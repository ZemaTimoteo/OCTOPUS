abstract = {Artifacts appear in MRI for a variety of reasons. Potential sources of artifacts include nonideal hardware characteristics, intrinsic tissue properties and biological behavior, assumptions underlying the data acquisition and image reconstruction process, and poor choice of scanning parameters. Careful study design and scanning protocols can prevent certain artifacts from occurring, but some are unavoidable. Numerous correction methods have been developed to mitigate the corruptive effects of artifacts and improve image diagnostic quality. These methods include special pulse sequence designs, improved scanning procedures and equipment, and advanced postprocessing algorithms. Recognizing artifacts and understanding their underlying causes are important when interpreting images and choosing a correction approach. {\textcopyright} 2010 Future Medicine Ltd.},

abstract = {When time-varying gradients are used for imaging, the off-resonance behavior does not just cause geometric distortion as is the case with spin-warp imaging, but changes the shape of the impulse response and causes blurring. This effect is well known for projection reconstruction and spiral k-space scanning sequences. We introduce here a reconstruction and homogeneity correction method to correct for the zeroth order effects of inhomogeneity using a priori knowledge of the inhomogeneity. In this method, the data are segmented according to collection time, reconstructed using some fast, linear algorithm, corrected for inhomogeneity and then superimposed to yield a homogeneity corrected image. This segmented method is compared to a conjugate phase reconstruction in terms of degree of correction and execution time. We apply this method to in vivo images using projection-reconstruction and spiralscan sequences. {\textcopyright} 1991 IEEE},

@article{LukPat2001,
abstract = {Off-resonant spins, produced by chemical shift, tissue-susceptibility differences, or main-field inhomogeneity, can cause blurring or shifts, severely compromising the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance images. To mitigate these off-resonance effects, the authors propose a technique whereby two images are acquired at different echo times (TEs) and interpolated to produce a single image with dramatically-reduced blurring. The phase difference of these two images is not used to produce a field map; instead, the weighted complex-valued average of the two images is used to produce a single image. Previously-described methods reconstruct a set of preliminary images, each at a different off-resonant frequency, and then assemble these into one final image, choosing the best off-resonant frequency for each voxel. Compared to these methods, the proposed technique requires the same or less processing time and is much less sensitive to errors in the field map. This technique was applied to centric-ordered EPI but it can be applied to any imaging trajectory, including one-shot EPI, spiral imaging, projection-reconstruction imaging, and 2D GRASE. {\textcopyright} 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Spiral scanning is a promising MRI method, but one limitation is that off-resonance effects can cause image blurring. Most current off-resonance correction methods for spiral imaging require an accurate field map, which is difficult to obtain in many applications. Automatic methods can perform off-resonance correction without acquiring a field map. However, these methods are computationally inefficient and relatively prone to estimation error. This study describes a new semiautomatic off-resonance correction method that combines an automatic method with a low resolution field map acquisition for off-resonance correction in spiral scanning. Experiments demonstrate that this method is more robust than conventional automatic off-resonance correction and can provide more accurate off-resonance correction than conventional field map based methods. The proposed method is also computationally efficient and has been implemented for online reconstruction. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

This method estimates spin density by calculating the “weighted” correlation of the observed FID signal and the phase modulation function at each point. A theorem which states that this method can be derived from the conditions of linearity and shift invariance is presented. Since these conditions are general, most of the MRI reconstruction algorithms proposed so far are equivalent to the weighted correlation method. An explicit representation of the point spread function (PSF) in the weighted correlation method is given. By using this representation, a method to control the PSF and the static field inhomogeneity effects are studied. A correction method for the inhomogeneity effects is proposed, and a limitation is clarified. Some simulation results are also presented. {\textcopyright} 1988 IEEE},

In this method, the raw data are modulated to several different frequencies and reconstructed to create a series of base images. Determination of degree of blur is done by calculating a focusing measure for each point in each base image and a composite image is then constructed using only the unblurred regions from each base image.

The reconstruction problem is formulated as an optimization that yields the most consistent solution with the calibration and acquisition data. The approach is general and can accurately reconstruct images from arbitrary k-space sampling patterns. The formulation can flexibly incorporate additional image priors such as off-resonance correction and regularization terms that appear in compressed sensing. Several iterative strategies to solve the posed reconstruction problem in both image and k-space domain are presented. These are based on a projection over convex sets and conjugate gradient algorithms. Phantom and in vivo studies demonstrate efficient reconstructions from undersampled Cartesian and spiral trajectories. Reconstructions that include off-resonance correction and nonlinear ℓ1-wavelet regularization are also demonstrated. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{Sutton2003,
abstract = {In magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic field inhomogeneities cause distortions in images that are reconstructed by conventional last Fourier transform (FFT) methods. Several noniterative image reconstruction methods are used currently to compensate for field inhomogeneities, but these methods assume that the field map that characterizes the off-resonance frequencies is spatially smooth. Recently, iterative methods have been proposed that can circumvent this assumption and provide improved compensation for off-resonance effects. However, straightforward implementations of such iterative methods suffer from inconveniently long computation times. This paper describes a tool for accelerating iterative reconstruction of field-corrected MR images: a novel time-segmented approximation to the MR signal equation. We use a min-max formulation to derive the temporal interpolator. Speedups of around 60 were achieved by combining this temporal interpolator with a nonuniform fast Fourier transform with normalized root mean squared approximation errors of 0.07{\%}. The proposed method provides fast, accurate, field-corrected image reconstruction even when the field map is not smooth.},

@article{Fessler2005,
abstract = {In some types of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, particularly functional brain scans, the conventional Fourier model for the measurements is inaccurate. Magnetic field inhomogeneities, which are caused by imperfect main fields and by magnetic susceptibility variations, induce distortions in images that are reconstructed by conventional Fourier methods. These artifacts hamper the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) in brain regions near air/tissue interfaces. Recently, iterative methods that combine the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm with nonuniform FFT (NUFFT) operations have been shown to provide considerably improved image quality relative to the conjugate-phase method. However, for non-Cartesian k-space trajectories, each CG-NUFFT iteration requires numerous k-space interpolations; these are operations that are computationally expensive and poorly suited to fast hardware implementations. This paper proposes a faster iterative approach to field-corrected MR image reconstruction based on the CG algorithm and certain Toeplitz matrices. This CG-Toeplitz approach requires k-space interpolations only for the initial iteration; thereafter, only fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) are required. Simulation results show that the proposed CG-Toeplitz approach produces equivalent image quality as th CG-NUFFT method with significantly reduced computation time. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},
