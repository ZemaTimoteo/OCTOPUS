OCTOPUS: Off-resonance CorrecTion OPen-soUrce Software
======================================================

`OCTOPUS <https://github.com/imr-framework/OCTOPUS>`_ is an open-source tool that provides off-resonance correction methods for Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. In particular, the implemented techniques are Conjugate Phase Reconstruction (CPR) [1]_, frequency-segmented CPR [2]_ and Multi-Frequency Interpolation (MFI) [3]_.

It is targeted to MR scientists, researchers, engineers and students who work with off-resonance-prone trajectories, such as spirals.
